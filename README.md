snoopi
======


Snoopi is an open source configurable multi-host multi-threaded link checking tool. Two default url extraction techniques are:
  1. Extract urls upto specified level
  2. Pickup urls from a file containing a list of urls

The URL extractor class can be modified to add more url extraction methods, which can then be plugged in the driver class.
